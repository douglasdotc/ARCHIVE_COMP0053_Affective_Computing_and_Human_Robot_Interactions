The code in this notebook comprises entirely the completion of all tasks for part 2 of the ACHRI CW1.

In order to be run, the EmoPain data must be extracted from the downloadable zip INTO the same directory as this notebook upon execution.

All modules imported are at the top of the notebook and are required to run the code. 

All code is documented within the notebook and is relatively easy to understand. 

Running the whole code can take a very long time depending on machine in use and it is recommended that if a user wants proof the code works and wants results (although perhaps sub-optimal) it is recommended to decrease the 'samps' variable that appears at numerous location in the notebook.
